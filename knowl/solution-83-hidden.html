<p>We begin by asking a question, and answering the question in two ways:</p>
<p>“How many subsets of size \(k\) are there from a set of size \(n\text{?}\)”</p>
<p>Answer one: There are \(\binom{n}{k}\) such subsets.</p>
<p>Answer two: Pick any element of the set. That element is either included in a subset, or it is not.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>How many subsets contain this element? We will be picking from the remaining \(n-1\) elements. Since we want the subsets to have \(k\) elements, but we already have one of them, we have a total of \(\binom{n-1}{k-1}\) such subsets.</li>
<li>How many subsets do not contain this element? We will be picking from the remaining \(n-1\) elements. Since we want the subsets to have \(k\) elements, we have \(\binom{n-1}{k}\) such subsets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus there are \(\binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}\) subsets of \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements.</p>
<p>Because each answer counted the same objects, but in two different ways, those answers much be the same. Thus</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
{n \choose k} = {n-1\choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}.
\end{equation*}
