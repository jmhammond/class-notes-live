<p>Question: How many \(k\)-letter words can you make using \(n\) different letters without repeating any letter?</p>
<p>Answer 1: There are \(n\) choices for the first letter, \(n-1\) choices for the second letter, \(n-2\) choices for the third letter, and so on until \(n - (k-1)\) choices for the \(k\)th letter (since \(k-1\) letters have already been assigned at that point). The product of these numbers can be written \(\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\) which is \(P(n,k)\text{.}\)  Therefore there are \(P(n,k)\) words.</p>
<p>Answer 2: First pick \(k\) letters to be in the word from the \(n\) choices. This can be done in \({n \choose k}\) ways. Now arrange those letters into a word. There are \(k\) choices for the first letter, \(k-1\) choices for the second, and so on, for a total of \(k!\) arrangements of the \(k\) letters. Thus the total number of words is \({n \choose k}k!\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Since the two answers are correct answers to the same question, we have established that \(P(n,k) = {n \choose k}k!\text{.}\)</p></article>
