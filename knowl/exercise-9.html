<p>This is a favorite of my daughter. You encounter a guard standing at a fork in the road. It is not known whether the guard is a knight or a knave, that is, that they will (always) tell the truth or (always) lie. One of the paths leads to great treasure, the other leads to a violent and scary death. You are allowed to ask one and only one question to the guard.</p>
<p>What can you ask the guard in order to ensure you go on the path towards the treasure?</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-prop-logic.html#exercise-9">in-context</a></span>
